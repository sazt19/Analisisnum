        **Gauss-Jordan Elimination** is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It works by transforming the augmented matrix into a reduced row echelon form (RREF), from which the solution can be easily read.

        **Key Features:**
        - The method involves transforming the augmented matrix into a diagonal matrix (with 1s on the diagonal) using row operations.
        - It is a direct method for solving linear systems, i.e., it computes the solution in a finite number of steps.
        - This version of Gauss-Jordan does not use pivoting (which can improve numerical stability), meaning it may fail for singular or poorly conditioned matrices.

        **Procedure:**
        1. **Initialization**: Begin with the augmented matrix $[A | b]$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix and $b$ is the column vector of constants.

        2. **Row Reduction**: For each row $i$, ensure that the diagonal element $a_{ii}$ is non-zero. If it is zero, the algorithm swaps rows (this would be avoided in Gauss-Jordan with pivoting, but it's still possible in this method with a check).

        3. **Elimination**: Eliminate all elements below the pivot (diagonal element) by subtracting a multiple of the row from the other rows.

        4. **Normalize Diagonal Elements**: Divide each row by the diagonal element $a_{ii}$ to ensure that the diagonal element becomes 1.

        5. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, the solution is obtained directly from the matrix.

        **Formula for Row Operations**:
        - Subtract a multiple of one row from another to eliminate off-diagonal elements:

        **Advantages**:
        - Simple to understand and implement.
        - Direct method that provides an exact solution if the matrix is non-singular.

        **Disadvantages**:
        - Computationally expensive, with a time complexity of $O(n^3)$.
        - Not stable for matrices that are poorly conditioned or singular.
        - Without pivoting, it is vulnerable to division by zero or round-off errors.
