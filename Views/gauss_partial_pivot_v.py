    **Gauss-Jordan Elimination with Partial Pivoting** is an improved version of the traditional Gauss-Jordan method. It introduces partial pivoting to enhance numerical stability and avoid issues such as division by zero or poor conditioning of matrices.

    **Key Features:**
    - **Partial Pivoting:** At each step, the algorithm swaps rows to ensure the largest absolute value in the column is selected as the pivot element. This reduces numerical errors and improves stability.
    - **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF):** Like the standard Gauss-Jordan method, the algorithm transforms the augmented matrix into RREF for direct extraction of solutions.
    - Solves systems of linear equations in a finite number of steps.

        **Procedure:**
        1. **Initialization**: Begin with the augmented matrix $[A | b]$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, and $b$ is the column vector of constants.

        2. **Partial Pivoting**: At each step, identify the row with the largest absolute value in the current pivot column and swap it with the current row.

        3. **Row Reduction**: Perform row operations to eliminate all elements below and above the pivot (diagonal element).

        4. **Normalize Diagonal Elements**: Divide each row by the diagonal element to make the diagonal entries equal to 1.

        5. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, extract the solution directly from the matrix.

        **Row Operations**:
        - Swap rows to bring the row with the largest pivot element to the top:

        **Advantages**:
        - More numerically stable than the standard Gauss-Jordan method.
        - Handles poorly conditioned matrices better.
        - Reduces the likelihood of division by zero.

        **Disadvantages**:
        - Slightly more computational overhead due to row swapping.
        - Still has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$.

        **Use Cases**:
        - Solving systems of linear equations where numerical stability is a concern.
        - Applications requiring exact solutions for non-singular matrices.
