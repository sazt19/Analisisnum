    **Cubic Spline Interpolation** is a method for interpolating data points using piecewise cubic polynomials. Each segment of the spline is a cubic polynomial, and the method ensures that the overall function is smooth, continuous, and its first and second derivatives are also continuous across all intervals.

    **Key Features:**
    - Each piece of the spline is a cubic polynomial.
    - The spline is continuous, and both the first and second derivatives are continuous at the interior points.
    - The method provides a smooth curve without sharp turns or discontinuities.

        3. **Solve for Coefficients**: The system of equations formed by these conditions is solved to determine the coefficients $ a_i $, $ b_i $, $ c_i $, and $ d_i $.

        **Advantages:**
        - Produces a smooth, continuous curve with no abrupt changes in slope or curvature.
        - Often used for applications requiring smooth interpolations like computer graphics or numerical simulations.

        **Disadvantages:**
        - Requires solving a system of linear equations, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets.
        - May not perform well if the data is highly oscillatory or has outliers.
