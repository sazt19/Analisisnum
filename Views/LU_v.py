    **LU Factorization** is a matrix decomposition method that breaks a square matrix $A$ into the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$. This is particularly useful for solving systems of linear equations, as it simplifies the process into forward and backward substitution steps.

    **Key Features:**
    - The matrix $A$ is decomposed such that $A = L \cdot U$, where:
      - $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal.
      - $U$ is an upper triangular matrix.
    - Allows for efficient computation of solutions for multiple right-hand side vectors $b$ once $L$ and $U$ are determined.
    - Requires the matrix to be non-singular (determinant ≠ 0).

        **Procedure:**
        1. **Initialization**: Start with a square matrix $A$ and create an identity matrix $L$ and a copy of $A$ for $U$.

        2. **Decomposition**:
        - For each column $i$, divide the elements below the diagonal by the pivot element $a_{ii}$ to determine the factors for elimination.
        - Subtract the scaled row $i$ from each subsequent row to create zeros below the diagonal in $U$.
        - Store the factors in the corresponding positions of $L$.

        3. **Validation**:
        - If a pivot element $a_{ii}$ is zero, the matrix cannot be decomposed without permuting rows, and the algorithm halts.

        **Forward and Backward Substitution**:
        - Once $L$ and $U$ are computed, the solution to $Ax = b$ is obtained in two steps:
        1. Solve $L \cdot y = b$ using forward substitution.
        2. Solve $U \cdot x = y$ using backward substitution.

        **Mathematical Formulas**:
        - Eliminate elements below the pivot:

        **Advantages**:
        - Efficient for solving multiple systems $Ax = b$ with the same $A$ but different $b$.
        - Reduces computational effort compared to Gaussian elimination for repeated solutions.

        **Disadvantages**:
        - Cannot decompose singular matrices without row permutations.
        - Requires careful handling of numerical precision, particularly for small pivot elements.

        **Use Cases**:
        - Solving large systems of linear equations.
        - Computing determinants (as the product of the diagonal elements of $U$).
        - Matrix inversion and numerical methods in scientific computing.
