    The **Linear Spline Interpolation Method** is a piecewise linear approach for interpolating between data points.

        **Steps:**
        - For each pair of adjacent data points, compute the linear spline using the above formula.
        - Combine these splines to form the complete piecewise linear interpolation.

        **Advantages:**
        - Simple and easy to compute.
        - Provides a continuous function without oscillation.

        **Disadvantages:**
        - Does not ensure smoothness of the first derivative between segments (i.e., the slope can change abruptly).
