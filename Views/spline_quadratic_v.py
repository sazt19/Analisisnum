        **Quadratic Spline Interpolation** is a method that uses piecewise quadratic functions to interpolate between data points. Unlike linear splines, which are piecewise linear, quadratic splines provide a smoother interpolation by using quadratic functions for each interval.

        **Key Features:**
        - Each piece of the spline is a quadratic function.
        - The spline is continuous, and its first derivative is continuous at the interior points.
        - The second derivative is continuous at the second interior point, ensuring smoothness.

        4. **Solve for Coefficients**: Using the system of equations formed by these constraints, we solve for the coefficients $ a_i $, $ b_i $, and $ c_i $.

        **Advantages:**
        - Provides a smoother interpolation compared to linear splines.
        - Ensures continuity of the first derivative.

        **Disadvantages:**
        - Requires solving a system of equations, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets.
